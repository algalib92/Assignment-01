                <h2>Mission</h2>
                <p>The human race has faced an enemy like no other these last few months, one that has made time stand
                    still for our nation and our world. Never in our lifetimes have we faced a crisis like this one.
                    Homes have turned into offices, schools, sanctuaries. Social distancing has become common language.
                    We have been stretched to imagine a new way of life, a new normal. Stretched, but not broken. Each
                    day that passes brings the hope of a healthier tomorrow.</p>

                <h2>Vission</h2>
                <p>Joining with our colleagues and our physicians, we are taking action to ensure – now more than ever –
                    that you are in safe hands. We have established enhanced protections throughout our sites of care to
                    create a safe environment for everyone who walks through our doors. There’s a lot to worry about in
                    these uncertain times – getting healthcare shouldn’t be one of them.</p>

                <h2>Goals</h2>
                <p>In front of us all is the chance to move forward. To move beyond fear. To define our new normal. To
                    find our healthier tomorrow. To fix broken hearts and broken bones. To lessen the pain and cure
                    disease. To tend to ailments so that you can find peace of mind. We will walk alongside you as you
                    step back into your life, starting with your health.</p>
